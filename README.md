a low-power wireless underground sensor network nodes was designed.

we analyzed the attenuation prediction values of the **modified Frisian transmission model** and the **complex refractive index Fresnel model** under different soil components, targeting their weaknesses and combining their strengths. The result is not good.

we proposed a fusion optimization model, and proposed an **improved Genetic Algorithm**, which is automatically adjust fusion parameter according to soil and distance factors, it made the prediction of signal attenuation under different soil components **more accurately**. The results shown that the proposed optimization model with automatic parameter is convenient to predict the signal attenuation, the optimization model **made the prediction error stay really low, and achieved the goal of reducing the prediction error**.
