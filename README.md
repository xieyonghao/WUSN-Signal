### **[A Self-adjusting Parametric Model for Attenuation Characteristics of WUSN Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14156) [NeurIPS 2022 [bib](https://github.com/xieyonghao/WUSN Signal#citation)]**  
[Jiwe Zhang], [Yonghao Xie](https://github.io/xieyonghao), [Mingze Yuan], [Mingbao Li*]   

we proposed a **fusion optimization model**, and proposed an **improved Genetic Algorithm**, which is automatically adjust fusion parameter according to soil and distance factors, it made the prediction of signal attenuation under different soil components more accurately

a low-power wireless underground sensor network nodes was designed.

we analyzed the attenuation prediction values of the **modified Frisian transmission model** and the **complex refractive index Fresnel model** under different soil components, targeting their weaknesses and combining their strengths. The result is not good.

TVLT is pre-trained with vision-audio mathcing and mask autoencoding **(mask and then reconstruct the continuous input of video frames and audio spectrogram)**, following the previous idea of [training scalable vision learners with mask autoencoding on images (the Vision-BERT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377).

TVLT attains performance comparable to its text-based counterpart on various multimodal tasks, such as visual question answering and multimodal sentiment analysis, **with 28x faster inference speed and only 1/3 of the parameters**.

## Install
### Setup `python` environment
```
conda create -n TVLT python=3.8   # You can also use other environment.
```

### Install `pytorch`, `torchvision`, and `torchaudio`
The following version have been tested.  
* `torch  1.10.0  1.12.1`
* `torchvision  0.11.1  0.12.1` 
* `torchaudio  0.10.0  0.13.1`  

You can try other version of `pytorch` but make sure that it will be compatible with your `cuda` and `cudnn`.  

### Install other dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Recommanded Usage

In our experiment, we pre-train TVLT on HowTo100M and YTtemporal videos. However, we recommend to unlock the power of TVLT by pre-training TVLT on large-scale videos for more generic Vision-Language representation.  
The resultant models can be either use to directly process video (with the audio channel) inputs such as audio-image/video retrieval, audio-VQA, TTS-based VQA or to extract visual-acoustic features for other tasks such as speech translation, multimodal content understanding, etc.
